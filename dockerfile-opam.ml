  "Each container comes with an initialised OPAM repository pointing to the central repository.  There are [ONBUILD](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#onbuild) triggers to update the OS distribution and OPAM database when a new container is built.  The default user in the container is called `opam`, and `sudo` is configured to allow password-less access to `root`.\n";
  "To build an environment for the [Jane Street Core](https://realworldocaml.org/) library on the latest stable OCaml, a simple Dockerfile looks like this:\n";
  "```\nFROM ocaml/opam\nopam depext -i core\n```";
  "You can build and use this image locally for development by saving the Dockerfile and:\n";
  "```\ndocker build -t ocaml-core .\ndocker run -ti ocaml-core bash\n```\n";
  "You can also use the Docker [volume sharing](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#volume) to map in source code from your host into the container to persist the results of your build.  You can also construct more specific Dockerfiles that use the full range of OPAM commands for a custom development environment.  For example, to build the [MirageOS](https://mirage.io) bleeding edge OCaml environment, this Dockerfile will add in a custom remote:\n";
  "```\nFROM ocaml/opam:ubuntu-15.10_ocaml-4.02.3\nopam remote add dev git://github.com/mirage/mirage-dev\nopam depext -i mirage\n```\n";
  "\n\nContributing\n==========\n\nTo discuss these containers, please e-mail Anil Madhavapeddy <anil@recoil.org> or the OPAM development list at <opam-devel@lists.ocaml.org>. Contributions of Dockerfiles for additional OS distributions are most welcome! The files here are all autogenerated from the [ocaml-docker-scripts](https://github.com/avsm/ocaml-docker-scripts) repository, so please do not submit any PRs directly to this location. The containers are built and hosted on the Docker Hub [ocaml organisation](https://hub.docker.com/u/ocaml)."]
